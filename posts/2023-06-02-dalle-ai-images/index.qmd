# AI images with DALL-E

Today, I became aware of an OpenAI service to generate images — [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/).

This has worked well and may solve my issue of needing images for blog posts, readme documents, and other content. I like having visual elements in writings and presentations.

Sometimes, images from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) worked well. It often took some time to find nice images. DALL-E may be a quicker approach to get an image.

I had to pay for the service but the number of images that can be generated for 15$ seem to be resonable.

I have still to twist the art styles to results that I like.

Here are some examples.

“a man working on a computer -- style Pieter Bruegel the Elder”

“a working class man on a computer -- leipzig school art style”
