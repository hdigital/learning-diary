# TIL February

## 25.2.

I worked on [code](https://github.com/hdigital/mixtape) from a causal inference book. It includes Stata, R and Python versions of the examples.

For R and Python I wanted to have one environment to install all dependencies. This led me to [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html).

Creating a new conda environment in a new file was extremly slow. It also took me a while to fully configure Jupyter Lab with Python and R.

At the end, VS Code seems to be the move convinient interface.
