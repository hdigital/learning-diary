# Conditional R cells

For R notebooks in Quarto not all information that can be presented in an html-document is feasible for the respective pdf-document. So sometimes, I want to include information in html but not in the pdf.

Interactive data tables with [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) are an example. They allow to explore smaller data sets quickly within a notebook, but work only in html documents. A pdf simply fails to render with Quarto.

So I was looking for a solution to execute R code in a notebook only for the html-document but not the pdf.

Conditional chunk execution is not implemented in Quarto so far â€” see [ticket #3260](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3260).

However, for R I found an approach that is working well.

```{r}
if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  print("code block run")
}
```

```{r}
if (! knitr::is_html_output()) {
  print("code block not run")
}
```
