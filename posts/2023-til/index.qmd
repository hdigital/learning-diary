I keep brief information here. Mainly things I learned that don't create a post.

## 2. May

A [bug](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/12452) in the current version of RStudio kept me busy. I reinstalled R and RStudio on Windows, but RStudio did not find the new R version afterwards. So I reinstalled the two and it kept not working. Fortunately, I found information about the RStudio bug somewhat quickly. I installed the [daily build](https://dailies.rstudio.com/rstudio/mountain-hydrangea/) and had R/RStudio running again.

Originally, I only wanted to do a quick data analysis but my previous R/RStudio updates came in between. 

## 25. Apr.

I got back into [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and created a website for a learning project I have started. My goal is to have some structured information about topics of a book I am reading and some code snippets that apply concepts of the book.

Setting up the page worked well. I got a little confused by the quarto difference between _freeze_ and _cache_. I also wondered why the _cache_ was added into several folders in the main directory and not into a *\_cache* folder.

## 3. Apr.

I read about the new [pandas release](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html). None of the changes seem to be relevant for my work with _pandas_

## 25. Feb.

I worked on [code](https://github.com/hdigital/mixtape) from a causal inference book. It includes Stata, R and Python versions of the examples.

For R and Python I wanted to have one environment to install all dependencies. This led me to [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html).

Creating a new conda environment in a new file was extremly slow. It also took me a while to fully configure Jupyter Lab with Python and R.

At the end, VS Code seems to be the more convenient interface.
