<!--- I keep brief information here. Mainly things I learned that don't create a post. -->

## 29. June

Didn't know [n_distinct()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/n_distinct.html) and used `length(unique())` for too long. A small and nice thing i learned that makes pipes more readable.

## 13. June

Adding a comment in Markdown by using standard html comments. It works for Markdown in [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) used by Quarto.

```
<!--- comment  -->

<!---
multi-line
comments
-->
```

I used it now with the current TIL page to have a short intro about a new TIL on the landing page. The previous one sentence summary of the page is now a comment.

## 10. June

Adding a [page break](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#page-breaks) to a pdf in Quarto.

```{.markdown shortcodes="false"}
---
format: pdf
---

Page 1

{{< pagebreak >}}

Page 2
```

In addition, I learned to ignore shortcuts in a cell with `{.markdown shortcodes="false"}`

## 9. June

I wanted to run a [Bash]() shell script from any folder. The initial solution worked on my local computer but not on GitHub Codespaces. Here is the solution I came up with. The script runs from any location or stops and gives a message that it should be run from the script folder.

```bash
# Use path relative to script location, if feasible
if [ -n "$BASH_SOURCE" ]; then
    cd "$( cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" ; pwd -P )"
else
    if ! [ -e "package-lock.json" ]; then
        echo "Run script in project folder"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

## 17. May

Another use of the Base-R shorthand anonymous function and explaining it to a colleague. I like to use `.x` now for the local variable name to make the local context more explicit.

`add_three <- \(.x) .x+3`

## 6. May

Excluding variables in _tidyselect_ is now done with `!` as I found out by reading the [documentation](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/language.html) more carfully. I have still used `-` to exclude variables by their name. This is not documented in the tidyselect help page anymore.

[readstata13](https://github.com/sjewo/readstata13) creates more R friendly data structures than [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/). Its default option converts labeled data into factors if appropriate.

## 5. May

Used [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) a lot and got more comfortable with the options â€” esp. caching, creating pdf, figures.

## 3. May

Convert an RMarkdown file into an R file with `knitr::purl("purl.Rmd")` -- see [details](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/purl.html).

ChatGPT did not provide the solution. I remembered doing this years ago. An internet search quickly led to the information needed.

## 2. May

A [bug](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/12452) in the current version of RStudio kept me busy. I reinstalled R and RStudio on Windows, but RStudio did not find the new R version afterwards. So I reinstalled the two and it kept not working. Fortunately, I found information about the RStudio bug somewhat quickly. I installed the [daily build](https://dailies.rstudio.com/rstudio/mountain-hydrangea/) and had R/RStudio running again.

Originally, I only wanted to do a quick data analysis but my previous R/RStudio updates came in between.

## 25. Apr.

I got back into [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and created a website for a learning project I have started. My goal is to have some structured information about topics of a book I am reading and some code snippets that apply concepts of the book.

Setting up the page worked well. I got a little confused by the quarto difference between _freeze_ and _cache_. I also wondered why the _cache_ was added into several folders in the main directory and not into a *\_cache* folder.

## 3. Apr.

I read about the new [pandas release](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html). None of the changes seem to be relevant for my work with _pandas_

## 25. Feb.

I worked on [code](https://github.com/hdigital/mixtape) from a causal inference book. It includes Stata, R and Python versions of the examples.

For R and Python I wanted to have one environment to install all dependencies. This led me to [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html).

Creating a new conda environment in a new file was extremly slow. It also took me a while to fully configure Jupyter Lab with Python and R.

At the end, VS Code seems to be the more convenient interface.
