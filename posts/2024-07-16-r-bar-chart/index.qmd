# Bar charts with ggplot

Horizontal bar charts are a regular part of my work with graphs in R.
Nevertheless, I have to look up the details regularly, so here is another example.

The graph visualizes the disproportionality of the results in the recent
[UK election 2024](https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2024/uk/results).

It uses [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) to order categories,
here the parties, by another value in the dataset, here the vote share.

The color codes of the parties are based on the BBC election page. I just used
_inspect_ on the internet browser to find the respective color code used on the page.

Finding the details for the parameters to customize the legend and the axes in
ggplot took some time. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot),
my new AI pair programmer, was very helpful. In fact, I use it a lot now to
get examples for the use of various tidyverse functions, that I used to
look up regularly.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

ggplot2::theme_set(theme_minimal())


elec_raw <- read_csv("uk-election-2024_bbc.csv")

pl_dt <-
  elec_raw |>
  mutate(
    seat_share = round(seats / 650 * 100, 1), # total seats UK Parliament: 650
    party = fct_reorder(party, vote_share)
  ) |>
  filter(vote_share >= 2.5)

party_colors <-
  c(
    "Lab" = "#E91D0E",
    "Con" = "#0575C9",
    "R-UK" = "#12b6cf",
    "Lib" = "#FF9A02",
    "Green" = "#99CC33",
    "SNP" = "#0AD1E0"
  )

pl1 <-
  ggplot(pl_dt, aes(x = vote_share, y = party, fill = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlim(0, 60) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = party_colors) +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

pl2 <-
  ggplot(pl_dt, aes(x = seat_share, y = party, fill = party)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = party_colors) +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), legend.position = "none")

pl1 + pl2 +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "UK election 2024",
    caption = "Source: BBC"
  )
```


```{r}
#| include: false

pl3 <- pl2 + theme(
  axis.label.x = element_blank(),
  axis.text.x = element_blank(),
  axis.title.x = element_blank()
)

ggsave("bar-chart.png", plot = pl3, width = 4, height = 3, dpi = 300)
```
