# Requests in JupyterLite

In a recent [post](../2023-11-23-jupyter-lite), I tried to use
[requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/) in
[JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html).
It did not work at the time.

Today, I have found out that
[urllib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3) recently
[announced](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#id2)
support for
[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/),
the Python distribution used by JupyterLite.

Now, you can use `requests` or `urllib3` in JupyterLite and this code does also
work in the browser environment (install packages with `micropip`).

```{python}
# import micropip
# await micropip.install("requests")

import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings()

import requests

headers = {"accept": "text/x-bibliography"}
r = requests.get("https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7043510", headers=headers)

r.text
```
