# File hashing

To increase the transparency of my work, I was interested in file hashing. It
allows to assign a unique value to a file. Such a value is calculated with a
defined algorithm.

In R, the [rlang](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) library provides the
[`hash_file()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/hash.html) function and uses
the XXH128 hash algorithm to generate a 128-bit hash.

This can be used to uniquely identify a data file. For reproducible research,
you can add hash values for the datafiles used in a project to uniquely
identify them.

Here, I have created two files for data sets from the _datasets_ library and
calculate the hash values of these files.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false

library(readr)

write_csv(datasets::iris, "iris.csv")
write_csv(datasets::mtcars, "mtcars.csv")
```

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

tibble(files = fs::dir_ls(glob = "*.csv")) |>
  mutate(hash = rlang::hash_file(files))
```
