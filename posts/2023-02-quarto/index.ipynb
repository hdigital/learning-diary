        "So I have had my first experience with creating dynamic documents in Quarto. It has been a pleasant experience. I could use some of my RMarkdown und knitr skills and like that it is a program independent of R and RStudio. Working in VS Code to create a blog on _Things I Learned_ worked well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Only working with Python was really challenging. For some time several attempts to find the local Python version in the `env` folder did not work. `quarto check` found the respective Python version but it was not used when I rendered the document. At the end it was simply the header option `jupyter: python3` in the qmd-document that did the trick.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rendering a document with Python and R cells remained a challenge. Again, it was an option that was missing. Setting `#| python.reticulate: false` in a Python cell solved the issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many of my Python struggles in Quarto may have been related to the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) R package.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Docker\n",
        "\n",
        "To get there I also created a `Dockerfile` to have an OS independent version of Quarto. That was another challenge until I first found a [Rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) configuration that worked with Python. It is a whopping 4.5 GB image but incudes Latex to create pdf-files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Later I did some more experimenting with Docker and created a Jupyter Lab Docker image that is also quite large with almost 5 GB. In addition, I created a smaller image that includes only a minimal Python and Jupyter Lab. At least this one is a little smaller than 1 GB.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll try to work with the local Quarto versions mainly but it is good to have OS independent Docker versions as well.\n",
