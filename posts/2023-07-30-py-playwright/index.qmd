# Screenshots with Playwright

I heard about [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library) in [Episode #424](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/424/shiny-for-python) of [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm/).

Here is an example of taking screenshots from the Playwright documentation which I updated for taking screenshots of this learning blog.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as spw:
    for browser_type in [spw.chromium, spw.firefox, spw.webkit]:
        browser = browser_type.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("https://hdigital.github.io/learning-diary/")
        page.screenshot(path=f"screenshot-{browser_type.name}.png")
        browser.close()
```

The code needs to be run in a Python script and does not run in Jupyter.
