My idea is to keep a more systematic collection of _things I learned_ (TIL).

I was inspired by posts of [Simon Wilson](https://til.simonwillison.net/) and [Peter Baumgartner](https://lincolnloop.com/insights/by-author/peter-baumgartner/) that documented things they have learned.

So here is an initial version and today the TIL has been [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Here is an example of integrating __Tidyverse-R__ code.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)

mtcars <- as_tibble(datasets::mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_smooth()
```

Here is an example of integrating __Python__ code.


```{python}
#| python.reticulate: false

import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

mtcars = sm.datasets.get_rdataset('mtcars').data

mtcars.plot(x = "hp", y = "mpg", kind = "scatter")
```

## Some background

Setting up a blog in Quarto was easy and well documented. So I started quickly.

Getting the right Python version running in Quarto was quite a challenge. ~~At the end, the documented recommendation to work with a virtual environment in an `env` folder worked. It took me some time to get there.~~

It only worked temporarily and I will try to run Python in Quarto again at some later point.

## Afterwards

It turned out that the particular challenge was having a page with R and Python.

For Python pages a header option was missing. `jupyter: python3` solved the Python challenge that took quite some time.

Rendering a Quarto document with __R and Python__ was only possible with a version Docker on the computer.
