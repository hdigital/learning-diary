# string interpolation with str_glue()

In R, I like string interpolation with [glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org/) and prefer it over Base-R `paste(), paste0(), sprintf()`. Regularly, I use `glue()` and forget to load the respective library at the top of the script or find `glue::glue()` rather verbose.

A tidyverse [blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/05/purrr-walk-this-way/) made me realize that [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) includes a `str_glue()` function that wraps `glue()`. stringr is loaded with `library(tidyverse)` so that I can include it into my regular tidyverse workflow.

It is also documented on the [stringr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/strings.pdf), but I have not relized that. It serves as useful reminder to look at the [Posit Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/) more regularly to review and update my workflow.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)

name <- "Jane"

str_glue("Hi {name}. How are you?")
```
