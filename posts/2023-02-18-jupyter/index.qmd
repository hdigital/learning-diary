# Jupyter notebooks with Quarto

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/index.html) notebooks can be rendered with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html).

In a first step, I create a simple notebook with the code from the Quarto documentation on Jupyter Lab. Secondly, I copied the notebook and added a Quarto header in a [Raw first cell](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html#yaml-front-matter). Finally, I converted the original notebook into a Quarto document with `quarto convert`.

I rendered all versions of the Jupyter notebook with Quarto and here are the results:

+ [Jupyter notebook](/snippets/jupyter.html)
+ [notebook with Quarto first cell](/snippets/jupyter-options.html)
+ [notebook converted to Quarto document](/snippets/jupyter-quarto.html)

I also learned that you have to pass an option when rendering ipynb-files -- `quarto render notebook.ipynb --execute`. The assumption is that a notebook was already run and that the results shall be rendered.

This all worked well for me and it solved a major issue I had with Jupyter notebooks. With R Markdown I really liked that you could convert a notebook into static HTML. To my knowledge, this was not possible with Jupyter notebooks. They could be exported to HTML in Jupyter Lab but not rendered into HTML.
