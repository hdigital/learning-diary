[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/index.html) notebooks can be rendered with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html).

In a first step, I create a simple notebook with the code from the Quarto documentation on Jupyter Lab. Secondly, I copied the notebook and added a Quarto header in a [Raw first cell](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html#yaml-front-matter). Finally, I converted the original notebook into a Quarto document with `quarto convert`.

I rendered all versions of the Jupyter notebook with Quarto and here are the results:

+ [Jupyter notebook](jupyter.html)
+ [notebook with Quarto first cell](jupyter-options.html)
+ [notebook converted to Quarto document](jupyter-quarto.html)
