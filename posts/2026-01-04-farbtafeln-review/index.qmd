[Farbtafel (Color Chart)](/snippets/farbtafeln.html) webpage — code review and updates · 🤖🔧

*Note: This post was drafted by Claude Sonnet 4 and revised by me.*

A year after creating the [Farbtafeln page](/posts/2025-01-05-farbtafeln/) ([2025 version](/snippets/farbtafeln-2025.html)) with ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, I revisited the project with Claude Sonnet 4 for a code review and updates. This session explored using AI as a code reviewer rather than just a code generator, with human guidance directing the process.

## Code review · 🔍

Claude reviewed the 'farbtafeln' page and identified several issues:

**Critical issues:**

- The color shuffle only shuffled rows as units, not individual colors across the grid.
- [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) was drawing continuously at 60fps despite static content.
- The p5.js version (1.11.2) was outdated.

**Best practice improvements:**

- The external link was missing security attributes.
- The canvas had a fixed 600px width and wasn't responsive.
- There was no window resize handler.

## The update process · 🛠️

### Planning and clarification

Claude proposed six improvements. I asked whether to shuffle all colors individually or preserve the row structure.

### Implementation iterations

The first implementation overcomplicated things by restructuring shuffled colors into a 2D array. I pointed out a simpler approach: flatten colors, shuffle them, and read sequentially with an index.

### Finding p5.js version 2

Claude found version 2.0.5 on cdnjs, but I noted that GitHub showed version 2.1.2. The cdnjs repository lagged behind—jsdelivr had the latest version.

### Testing the implementation

At my suggestion, Claude created verification scripts that checked the following:

- Shuffle algorithm
- HTML structure
- Version 2 API compatibility
- CDN availability
- p5.js functions

All tests passed.

## Lessons learned · 💡

**Human guidance matters.** AI proposed important updates, but corrections at key decision points prevented overengineering and ensured we used the latest p5.js version.

**Keep it simple.** A simple solution (flatten, shuffle, index) was better than the initial complexity.

**Test thoroughly.** Comprehensive testing revealed not just whether the code worked, but why it worked.

**Use AI as a reviewer.** Claude's code review was effective at identifying real issues and explaining them clearly while leaving the implementation open for refinement.

## Final thoughts · 💭

This session demonstrated to me once more how effective AI can be at reviewing and improving existing code. The page now:

- Shuffles colors correctly
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Performs efficiently
- Runs p5.js version 2.1.2

The iterative process felt like pair programming rather than simple delegation or passive code generation.
