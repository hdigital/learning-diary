# Horizontal bar chart

To have horizontal bar charts ordered by frequency, I have used `geom_bar()` and `coord_flip` for a long time.

I have now learned in an [example](https://www.eoda.de/en/wissen/blog/10-tidyverse-functions-that-might-save-your-day/#fct_reorder) that this is not necessary.

Here are a few examples and the code for future references.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars <- as_tibble(datasets::mtcars)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightgreen")
```

I used to do some pre-processing to prepare data for the plot.

```{r}
pl_dt <-
  mtcars |>
  mutate(cyl = fct_infreq(factor(cyl)) |> fct_rev())
```

For the figure, I used `coord_flip`.

```{r}
ggplot(pl_dt, aes(cyl)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "grey") +
  coord_flip()
```

That was not necessary, as I have learned now.

```{r}
ggplot(pl_dt, aes(y = cyl)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue")
```

Here is an alternative approach with `geom_col()`.

```{r}
pl_dt <-
  mtcars |>
  count(cyl) |>
  mutate(cyl = fct_reorder(factor(cyl), n))

ggplot(pl_dt, aes(x = n, y = cyl)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue")
```
