# First pull request accepted Â· ðŸ˜Š

My first public pull request on Github was [accepted](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/pull/1525).

Over the last weeks, I have been reading [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (R4DS). The first edition really helped me to get deeply into the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). So I was interested in the content of the second edition.

At some point, I realized that the book used an older parameter in `case_when()` that was recently superseded in [dplyr 1.1](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/02/dplyr-1-1-0-vctrs/#case_when). Since, I had switched to the new `.default` parameter already, I thought that it may be a small and valuable contribution to update the section.

Making the code changes was easy. It took me a little to find out how to clone the project and submit the pull requests. The GitHub documentation was helpful and it went smoothly following it.

I have used R4DS and the tidyverse so often that I am quite proud about my very minor addition to it.
