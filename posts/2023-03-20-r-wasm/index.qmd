# WebR (WebAssembly)

I read about the [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) release on the [Tidyverse blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/03/webr-0-1-0/). It allows to run R in a browser.

So I went to [webr.r-wasm.org](https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/) and gave it a try.

I tried to install the _tidyverse_ with `webr::install("tidyverse")`. That did not work. For me, there is little use of R without the _tidyverse_.

Installing _dplyr_ and _ggplot2_ individually worked. So that I could run the following code.

```{r}
#| message=FALSE

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

dt <- as_tibble(mtcars)
glimpse(dt)

ggplot(dt, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl)) + geom_point()
```

Typing the R commands in a browser shell without tab completion and no R help was challenging though.

Having R in a browser quickly available is nice ðŸ˜Š.
