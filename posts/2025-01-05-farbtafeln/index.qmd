[Farbtafel (Color Chart)](/snippets/farbtafeln-2025.html) webpage — Gerhard Richter inspired · 🤖🎨

Over the weekend, I ran into two books in our local bookstore.

- Schneede, U. M., & Richter, G. (2024). Gerhard Richter: Der unbedingte Maler.
  C.H.Beck. — [ISBN-13 978-3406821493](https://www.chbeck.de/schneede-gerhard-richter/product/36959113)
- Taulli, T. (2024). AI-assisted programming: Better planning, coding, testing,
  and deployment. O’Reilly. — [ISBN-13 978-1098164560](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-assisted-programming/9781098164553/)

For some time, I had the idea of creating a program to reproduce the
[_Farbtafeln_ (Color Charts)](https://www.gerhard-richter.com/de/art/paintings/abstracts/colour-charts-12)
by Gerhard Richter, a German painter. Richter's _Farbtafeln_ are a series of
abstract paintings composed of grids filled with randomly arranged colored
squares, showcasing his exploration of color and chance. This weekend, paired
with the inspiration from these two books, provided a good opportunity to bring
that idea to life and explore how AI could assist in such a creative programming
project.

## Project Overview · 📋

In this project, I created a program replicating Gerhard Richter's
_Farbtafeln_. By leveraging AI-assisted programming, I developed a webpage that
generates a random color grid inspired by Richter's work. This project
highlights the potential of AI assistants in creative coding.

It marks my first experience with AI assistants suggesting nearly all of
the code, which I then reviewed and refined. My knowledge of JavaScript,
Processing (_p5.js_), and CSS is rather limited and the AI assistants helped me
implement the _Farbtafeln_ efficiently.

The [resulting webpage](/snippets/farbtafeln-2025.html) dynamically reshuffles the
colors of the grid with each refresh, offering a fresh take on Richter's
exploration of randomness and color.

## Development · 🛠️

So here is a summary of my steps to create the _Farbtafeln_ code,
documentation, and this blog post with AI assistants.

### 1. Some Tech Background · 🧑‍💻

I knew that [_p5.js_](https://p5js.org/) would be a good fit for creating a
_Farbtafel_ webpage. _p5.js_ is a JavaScript library that simplifies the
creation of graphics and interactive content for the web.

However, my knowledge of _p5.js_, JavaScript, and CSS is limited. Building the
project from scratch with these tools would have been tedious for me. With the
help of AI assistants, the process became not only manageable but also
enjoyable.

### 2. A p5.js Script in ChatGPT · 🤖

To create the page, I started by uploading an image of one of the original
_Farbtafeln_ to ChatGPT and asking it to generate a _p5.js_ script to replicate
the image. I then revised the script. Here are the steps I took in ChatGPT:

- Defined the role for ChatGPT and provided information about my programming
  background.
- Uploaded a _Farbtafel_ image to ChatGPT and asked it to create a _p5.js_
  script.
- Got explanations for parts of the script.
- Modified the script to remove square borders and add padding.
- Refactored the script with ChatGPT's instructions (created functions).
- Created a webpage with the script.

While interacting with ChatGPT, I ran and modified the script in the [p5.js Web
Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) in another browser tab.

ChatGPT was an invaluable assistant to generate an initial version of the page,
generating code, offering clear explanations, and refining the _Farbtafeln_
script based on my inputs. It streamlined development and enriched my learning
experience, highlighting the benefits of AI in creative coding.

### 3. Completing with Copilot · 💻

After creating the initial script with ChatGPT, I turned to GitHub Copilot for
further refinements and enhancements. Here are the steps I followed with
Copilot:

- Created a project in VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled.
- Revised the script based on Copilot's recommendations.
- Added and refined CSS styles for the page.
- Added and revised page and script comments.

Copilot helped me create a simple yet visually appealing webpage. The additional
revisions I made to the processing script were minimal. I really appreciated the
workflow, with the script in my editor being modified based on Copilot’s
suggestions. It was an interactive process I preferred over the ChatGPT
chat-based interaction.

### 4. Creating the README · 📄

With GitHub Copilot, I generated a README file for the project by following
these steps:

- Created a new, empty `README.md` file in the project directory.
- Used Copilot to generate an initial draft.
- Reviewed and refined the content manually.
- Added links to relevant resources.

The structure of the suggested README was helpful, and the content provided some
good initial ideas. However, it was overly general and somewhat bloated, so I
significantly revised the document manually.

### 5. Writing the Blog Post · 📝

Finally, I asked GitHub Copilot to generate this blog post based on the page
code and the README. Here are the steps I used:

- Created an empty Markdown file.
- Asked Copilot to generate the blog post.
- Reviewed and revised each paragraph with Copilot.
- Added sentences and paragraphs manually.
- Revised and finalized the draft with ChatGPT.

The generated post served as a solid foundation, but I refined it significantly
to better reflect my experience. ChatGPT was particularly helpful for
fine-tuning the content and improving its flow, while Copilot provided a
reasonable starting point for structuring the post.

## Final Thoughts · 💭

This project was a great example of how AI, ChatGPT and Copilot, can assist in
the development process. By generating code and providing suggestions, AI
assistants helped streamline the creation of this random color grid. The result
is a simple and visually appealing webpage that pays homage to Gerhard
Richter's iconic color charts.

The code was generated quickly with ChatGPT, and I was impressed by the
quality. However, creating the documentation and blog post took more time.
While AI drafted the README and blog post, it was less instrumental,
and I spent significantly more time refining them manually.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this project, and I’m very pleased with how the
_Farbtafeln_-inspired webpage turned out. It brings Richter's exploration of
color and chance nicely into a digital space.
