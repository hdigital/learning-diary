# GitHub Codespaces

GitHub offered me to review the code of a pull request in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). It is an environment to run code online. I used it briefly before but not for one of my GitHub repositories. Today, I gave it a try for the pull request of a repository.

For the pull request, it created an environment with VS Code as the IDE and included Python as well as Git. I used it for a small Django project of mine. Two things were required to run my code. First, I needed to install the Python packages used by the project. The project includes a requirements file with pinned versions so that installing the dependencies was easy. Second, it asked me to add some VS Code extensions which I did as well.

Completing these two steps allowed me to work in an online enviroment very similiar to my local VS Code set up. It was linked to the GitHub repository so that I could sync my cloud changes with the project. I was impressed how smoothly it went and how little configuration it required.

I made some minor modifications to the project to use Codespaces even more effortlessly in the future. First, I updated my `settings.json.example` so that I can quickly create a copy in a Codesspaces `settings.json` that includes my settings. Second, I specified the VS Code extensions I am regularly using in a `launch.json`. These two additions should allow me to work in new Codespaces in the future even more quickly.

Overall, I really liked my first more in depth usage of Codespaces and plan to use it more in the future. I have yet to figure out how much I can use it with free quota and what monthly costs may occur by using it more regularly.
