# Python visualization with Altair

I have been interested in finding a visualization library for Python that is similar to [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) in R. I like the quick plots in [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) but [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) has never worked for me.

For customized visualizations I like the _ggplot2_ approach with layers. Its _grammar of graphics_ provides a good balance between adjusting a visualization and productivity. The code with layers is nicely readable.

[Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), a Python library, uses a grammar to create visualization as well. So I gave it a try and it went well -- see code below.

_pandas_ and _Altaire_ are likely to be the visualization tools that I use primarily in Python.

Here is some information on the [penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) 🐧 in the visualization. I didn't want to use _mtcars_ 🚗 again.

```{python}
import altair as alt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

dt = sns.load_dataset("penguins")

(alt.Chart(dt)
    .mark_circle()
    .encode(
      alt.X('flipper_length_mm', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
      alt.Y('body_mass_g', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
      color='species',
      tooltip=['species', 'island', 'sex']
    )
)
```


```{python}
dt
```
