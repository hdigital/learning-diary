Use [git force push safely](https://adamj.eu/tech/2023/10/31/git-force-push-safely/) (2023) with

```sh
git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes
```

For Python, I've configured my OS to prevent pip installations outside of virtual environments by setting the PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV environment variable. For this configuration `export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV="true"` is set in my .zshrc file. The configuration was inspired by the post [On pip isolation](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/03/04/pip-isolation.html).

Creating the [last post](../2024-02-26-f-strings) I realized that it is more convenient to work in VS Code with a Jupyter notebook (_ipynb_) than in a Quarto document (_qmd_). The notebook enables the use of Jupyter keyboard shortcuts whereas the Quarto document usage is rather static in VS Code.

The documents can be converted into the other format with

`quarto convert`


## 10. March

Recently, I started using the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command
runner and have now used it regularly in several of my Python projects.
