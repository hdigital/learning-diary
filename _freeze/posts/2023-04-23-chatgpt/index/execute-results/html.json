The author describes using ChatGPT to code a []() model.\n\nSo I had a conversation with ChatGPT about the social sciences, statistics and R.\n\nI have to say that I am impressed.\n\nChatGPT and I had an exchange about R. I asked for some examples. ChatGPT originally had a preference for Base-R code but it used more Tidyverse-R approaches after I asked for it. Or it converted the Base-R code to Tidyverse-R at my request.\n\nThe code examples were good and I really liked the comments it added to the code. At some point ChatGPT went back to Base-R and I could not fully convince it to use a Tidyverse-R first approach.\n\nSo here is a nice output from our exchange. I asked for a text analysis of a Biden speech in R.\n\nParts from the content of the exchange are below.\n\nI added the `rvest::read_html` parts from the ChatGPT suggestion. I did not find a way that ChatGPT added it to its initial script. ChatGPT had some Base-R and Tidyverse-R confusion at this point. I updated the title of the figure to the new speech title used as well.\n\nI don't use `tidytext` regularly so looking up the information would have taken some time for me. Here, ChatGPT was very helpful. Thanks.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(rvest)\n\n# Read in the HTML document\nhtml_doc <- read_html(\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/\")\n\n# Extract the text\nbiden_speech <- html_text(html_doc)\n\n# Tokenize speech\nbiden_words <- biden_speech %>%\n  enframe(name = NULL, value = \"text\") %>%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text)\n\n# Remove stop words\nbiden_words <- biden_words %>%\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n# Calculate word frequencies\nword_freq <- biden_words %>%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize word frequencies\nword_freq %>%\n  top_n(20) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(word, n))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Frequency\",\n    y = \"Word\",\n    title = \"Joe Biden's American Jobs Plan speech\",\n    subtitle = \"Most common words\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n__user__\ncan we analyse a biden speech?\n\n__ChatGPT__\nYes, we can use text analysis techniques to analyze a speech by Joe Biden. Here's an example using the `tidytext` package:\n\n```R\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\n# Load speech data\nbiden_speech <- read_lines(\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-covid-speech-transcript-september-9\")\n\n# Tokenize speech\nbiden_words <- biden_speech %>%\n  enframe(name = NULL, value = \"text\") %>%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text)\n\n# Remove stop words\nbiden_words <- biden_words %>%\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n# Calculate word frequencies\nword_freq <- biden_words %>%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize word frequencies\nword_freq %>%\n  top_n(20) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(word, n))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(x = \"Frequency\", y = \"Word\", title = \"Most common words in Joe Biden's COVID speech\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we load the transcript of a speech by Joe Biden on the topic of COVID-19, which is available as a text file from the Rev.com blog. We tokenize the speech using the `unnest_tokens()` function, remove stop words using the `anti_join()` function, and calculate word frequencies using the `count()` function. Finally, we visualize the most common words using `ggplot2`. Note that in order to run this code, you will need to have the `readr` package installed to read in the text file from the web.\n\n__user__\nthe url does not work\n\n__ChatGPT__\nI apologize for that. Here's an updated example using a different speech by Joe Biden that is available as a text file from the University of Pennsylvania:\n\n```R\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\n# Load speech data\nbiden_speech <- read_lines(\"https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jkingsby/BidenIowaSpeech.txt\")\n\n# Tokenize speech\nbiden_words <- biden_speech %>%\n  enframe(name = NULL, value = \"text\") %>%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text)\n\n# Remove stop words\nbiden_words <- biden_words %>%\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n# Calculate word frequencies\nword_freq <- biden_words %>%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize word frequencies\nword_freq %>%\n  top_n(20) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(word, n))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(x = \"Frequency\", y = \"Word\", title = \"Most common words in Joe Biden's Iowa speech\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we load a different speech by Joe Biden that is available as a text file from the University of Pennsylvania. The rest of the code is the same as in the previous example.\n\n__user__\nthat url is also not working. do you have a link for a biden speech\n\n__ChatGPT__\nI apologize for the inconvenience. Here is a link to a transcript of a recent speech by Joe Biden on infrastructure:\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/\n\nYou can copy the text of the speech from this page and use it in the `read_lines()` function to load it into R for analysis using the `tidytext` package.\n\n__user__\nhow can i convert a html document to text in r?\n\n__ChatGPT__\nYou can use the `rvest` package in R to extract text from HTML documents. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to do this:\n\n```R\nlibrary(rvest)\n\n# Read in the HTML document\nhtml_doc <- read_html(\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/\")\n\n# Extract the text\ntext <- html_text(html_doc)\n\n# Print the text\ncat(text)\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `read_html()` function from `rvest` to read in the HTML document from the provided URL. We then use the `html_text()` function to extract the text from the HTML document. Finally, we use `cat()` to print the text to the console.\n\nNote that the `rvest` package is designed for web scraping, so it is important to respect the terms of use and not use it to scrape websites without permission.\n\n__user__\nok, can you add that to the r code snippet above?\n\n__ChatGPT__\n\n(...)\n",
