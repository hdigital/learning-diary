So I started quickly.\n\nGetting the right Python version running in Quarto was quite a challenge. ~~At the end, the documented recommendation to work with a virtual environment in an `env` folder worked. It took me some time to get there.~~\n\nIt only worked temporarily and I will try to run Python in Quarto again at some later point.\n\n## Afterwards\n\nIt turned out that the particular challenge was having a page with R and Python.\n\nFor Python pages a header option was missing. `jupyter: python3` solved the Python challenge that took quite some time.\n\nRendering a Quarto document with __R and Python__ was only possible with a version Docker on the computer.\n",
