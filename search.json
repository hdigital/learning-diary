I run it on this learning diary Git repository to clean the two notebooks in the snippets folder.

This is not the original file and may include some import errors. I ran into the issue in previous work so that I have worked with the original data file from the Dataverse.

    "text": "R coding with ChatGPT\nFinally I got into ChatGPT and started using it.\nI was inspired to give ChatGPT a try after reading a post. The author describes using ChatGPT to code a  model.\nSo I had a conversation with ChatGPT about the social sciences, statistics and R.\nI have to say that I am impressed.\nChatGPT and I had an exchange about R. I asked for some examples. ChatGPT originally had a preference for Base-R code but it used more Tidyverse-R approaches after I asked for it. Or it converted the Base-R code to Tidyverse-R at my request.\nThe code examples were good and I really liked the comments it added to the code. At some point ChatGPT went back to Base-R and I could not fully convince it to use a Tidyverse-R first approach.\nSo here is a nice output from our exchange. I asked for a text analysis of a Biden speech in R.\nParts from the content of the exchange are below.\nI added the rvest::read_html parts from the ChatGPT suggestion. I did not find a way that ChatGPT added it to its initial script. ChatGPT had some Base-R and Tidyverse-R confusion at this point. I updated the title of the figure to the new speech title used as well.\nI don’t use tidytext regularly so looking up the information would have taken some time for me. Here, ChatGPT was very helpful. Thanks.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(rvest)\n\n# Read in the HTML document\nhtml_doc &lt;- read_html(\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/\")\n\n# Extract the text\nbiden_speech &lt;- html_text(html_doc)\n\n# Tokenize speech\nbiden_words &lt;- biden_speech %&gt;%\n  enframe(name = NULL, value = \"text\") %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text)\n\n# Remove stop words\nbiden_words &lt;- biden_words %&gt;%\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n# Calculate word frequencies\nword_freq &lt;- biden_words %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize word frequencies\nword_freq %&gt;%\n  top_n(20) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(word, n))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Frequency\",\n    y = \"Word\",\n    title = \"Joe Biden's American Jobs Plan speech\",\n    subtitle = \"Most common words\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser can we analyse a biden speech?\nChatGPT Yes, we can use text analysis techniques to analyze a speech by Joe Biden. Here’s an example using the tidytext package:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\n# Load speech data\nbiden_speech &lt;- read_lines(\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-covid-speech-transcript-september-9\")\n\n# Tokenize speech\nbiden_words &lt;- biden_speech %&gt;%\n  enframe(name = NULL, value = \"text\") %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text)\n\n# Remove stop words\nbiden_words &lt;- biden_words %&gt;%\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n# Calculate word frequencies\nword_freq &lt;- biden_words %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize word frequencies\nword_freq %&gt;%\n  top_n(20) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(word, n))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(x = \"Frequency\", y = \"Word\", title = \"Most common words in Joe Biden's COVID speech\")\nIn this example, we load the transcript of a speech by Joe Biden on the topic of COVID-19, which is available as a text file from the Rev.com blog. We tokenize the speech using the unnest_tokens() function, remove stop words using the anti_join() function, and calculate word frequencies using the count() function. Finally, we visualize the most common words using ggplot2. Note that in order to run this code, you will need to have the readr package installed to read in the text file from the web.\nuser the url does not work\nChatGPT I apologize for that. Here’s an updated example using a different speech by Joe Biden that is available as a text file from the University of Pennsylvania:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\n# Load speech data\nbiden_speech &lt;- read_lines(\"https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jkingsby/BidenIowaSpeech.txt\")\n\n# Tokenize speech\nbiden_words &lt;- biden_speech %&gt;%\n  enframe(name = NULL, value = \"text\") %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text)\n\n# Remove stop words\nbiden_words &lt;- biden_words %&gt;%\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n# Calculate word frequencies\nword_freq &lt;- biden_words %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize word frequencies\nword_freq %&gt;%\n  top_n(20) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(word, n))) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(x = \"Frequency\", y = \"Word\", title = \"Most common words in Joe Biden's Iowa speech\")\nIn this example, we load a different speech by Joe Biden that is available as a text file from the University of Pennsylvania. The rest of the code is the same as in the previous example.\nuser that url is also not working. do you have a link for a biden speech\nChatGPT I apologize for the inconvenience. Here is a link to a transcript of a recent speech by Joe Biden on infrastructure:\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/\nYou can copy the text of the speech from this page and use it in the read_lines() function to load it into R for analysis using the tidytext package.\nuser how can i convert a html document to text in r?\nChatGPT You can use the rvest package in R to extract text from HTML documents. Here’s an example code snippet that shows how to do this:\nlibrary(rvest)\n\n# Read in the HTML document\nhtml_doc &lt;- read_html(\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/\")\n\n# Extract the text\ntext &lt;- html_text(html_doc)\n\n# Print the text\ncat(text)\nIn this example, we use the read_html() function from rvest to read in the HTML document from the provided URL. We then use the html_text() function to extract the text from the HTML document. Finally, we use cat() to print the text to the console.\nNote that the rvest package is designed for web scraping, so it is important to respect the terms of use and not use it to scrape websites without permission.\nuser ok, can you add that to the r code snippet above?\nChatGPT\n(…)"

I also like to use it for mini-project that I work on from different machines.\nOver the last days, I used it a little more. One goal was to figure out how a more extensive use would work out.\nThis worked out well. I like just opening a browser and start working with R in RStudio. Especially, a Chrome browser with the tab in full screen mode works very well. It almost feels like working on a desktop application.\nWorking in Posit Cloud, I am still struggling slightly with two issues.\nFirst, not all shortcuts work the way I am used to from the RStudio desktop application. Some browser shortcuts take precedence over RStudio shortcuts. Showing the command pallete works. So I can use it to run a command from the keyboard. However, I am just used to some shortcuts that I am irritated if typing them does not lead to the expected next step working in RStudio.\nSecond, I find the file handling still a little inconvenient. Uploading a file into to project folder or moving files across project folders takes some steps and mulitple clicks. Here, the Posit Cloud interface to RStudio is just not as reactive as for example file handling in Google Drive.\nUsing RStudio with Posit Cloud regularly remains a regular part of my data science tools.\nActually, this time I used it so extensivly that I exceeded the free quota of my account. So I have to wait for a while until I can start using it again.\n\n\n\nPosit Cloud limit"

Today, I gave it a try for the pull request of a repository.\nFor the pull request, it created an environment with VS Code as the IDE and included Python as well as Git. I used it for a small Django project of mine. Two things were required to run my code. First, I needed to install the Python packages used by the project. The project includes a requirements file with pinned versions so that installing the dependencies was easy. Second, it asked me to add some VS Code extensions which I did as well.\nCompleting these two steps allowed me to work in an online enviroment very similiar to my local VS Code set up. It was linked to the GitHub repository so that I could sync my cloud changes with the project. I was impressed how smoothly it went and how little configuration it required.\nI made some minor modifications to the project to use Codespaces even more effortlessly in the future. First, I updated my settings.json.example so that I can quickly create a copy in a Codesspaces settings.json that includes my settings. Second, I specified the VS Code extensions I am regularly using in a launch.json. These two additions should allow me to work in new Codespaces in the future even more quickly.\nOverall, I really liked my first more in depth usage of Codespaces and plan to use it more in the future. I have yet to figure out how much I can use it with free quota and what monthly costs may occur by using it more regularly."

The first edition really helped me to get deeply into the tidyverse. So I was interested in the content of the second edition.\nAt some point, I realized that the book used an older parameter in case_when() that was recently superseded in dplyr 1.1. Since, I had switched to the new .default parameter already, I thought that it may be a small and valuable contribution to update the section.\nMaking the code changes was easy. It took me a little to find out how to clone the project and submit the pull requests. The GitHub documentation was helpful and it went smoothly following it.\nI have used R4DS and the tidyverse so often that I am quite proud about my very minor addition to it."
