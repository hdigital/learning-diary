The assumption is that a notebook was already run and that the results shall be rendered.\nThis all worked well for me and it solved a major issue I had with Jupyter notebooks. With R Markdown I really liked that you could convert a notebook into static HTML. To my knowledge, this was not possible with Jupyter notebooks. They could be exported to HTML in Jupyter Lab but not rendered into HTML.\n\n\n\nJupyter Lab"
